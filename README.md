## Project Overview
A simple and interactive web application that calculates the weight of an object on different planets within our solar system. This app leverages the gravitational differences between planets to show users how weight can vary depending on the planet they are on. Perfect for educational purposes or just for fun!

## Live Site
Check out the live site at [Project solar system ](https://ezekiel673.github.io/Object_weight_on_different_planets/)

## Features

- **Calculate Weight:** Enter the mass of an object and select a planet to see how much the object would weigh on that planet.
- **Interactive UI:** Visual representation of each planet with corresponding gravity-based weight calculation.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application, including animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for calculating weight based on planetary gravity and updating the UI.

## Usage

1. **Enter the Object's Mass**: In the input field labeled "Mass," type in the mass of the object in kilograms.
2. **Select a Planet**: Choose a planet from the dropdown menu. The app supports planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
3. **Calculate**: Click on the "Calculate" button to see the object's weight on the selected planet. The weight will be displayed along with an image of the planet.
